# STAT 153: Introduction to Time Series

This repository contains coursework completed for **STAT 153: Introduction to Time Series** at UC Berkeley. The course focuses on methods for analyzing sequential and time-dependent data by building mathematical models that provide plausible explanations and accurate forecasts of observed phenomena.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

Time series data is characterized by a temporal order among observations. The course covers a variety of time series models, including:

- Multiple linear regression models (with time-dependent covariates)
- Nonlinear regression models over time
- Regularized high-dimensional linear regression models
- Variance models and spectral analysis
- Lagged regression and ARIMA models
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data

These models are used to describe, analyze, and forecast patterns in real-world time series data.
